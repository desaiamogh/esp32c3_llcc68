This repo contains a firmware and build files for esp32c3 supermini and llcc68 rf module based simple (radio only) meshtastic node.

This in my view is possibly the cheapest meshtastic node with just 2 components

LCC68 RF Module (868-915MHz) at < $3 : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256805528427908.html
ESP32-C3 SuperMini Plus at > $3 : https://www.aliexpress.com/item/3256807958665407.html

i.e. a meshtastic node for about $5.

Its cheap and there are drawbacks to this setup which you can read more about at my blog https://amoghdesai.com/
